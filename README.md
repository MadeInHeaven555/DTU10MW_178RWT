# DTU10MW_FAST_LIN
This is a repo for using the DTU10 MW model in FAST linearization. The aerodyn15 was created in there for adapting with the openFAST linearization requirement. A comparison is also made at the rated points for demonstrating the accuracy of the revised model preliminarily. More comparisons have to be made in the future. Also, more work will be finished based on this model.

Comparison between the Aerodyn14 and Aerodyn15 regarding three power-generation measures.
